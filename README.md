We made a simple guess-the-number game, primarily run through the 7 segment with some VGA output based on user input (numbers 1-6). It works for the most part, though we had trouble displaying player one and player two's total scores.

Our project is run through the guess_userinput, bin2dec, sseg, top, and VGA files. The constraint file to use is constraint2. The vga and top files to use are under the sevseg branch.

The VGAcontroller handles the vga, guess_userinput handles the user input, the top file combines it all, and the sseg outputs all the values. There are also multiple switch and LED outputs indicating current player, a win, reset, the input, a hold, etc.

We managed to bring it together, mostly- though we know our project is not very flashy, many, many, many hours of work, as well as some tears, went into it. I hope that it will be sufficient.
